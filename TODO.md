# Regrets I have

This server setup is nothing short of *insane*. Not in a "monster truck with flames pointed on" way, but in a "human hair stapled to the wall" way.

Flask is a reidiculously overcomplicated solution to a _very simple_ problem. It should have been done with just FastAPI, while nginx is responsible for serving the HTML and other static files.

This flask app _doesn't actually do anything_ except for serve the API.
